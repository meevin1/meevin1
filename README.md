# Hey! I'm mv1!

I'm a programmer with a big passion for video games in particular, and it's my dream to make a big indie game. Right now I'm working on a top-down shooter reminiscent of Hotline Miami. I don't know if it'll go anywhere but it'll be fun, and it's a project I've wanted to do for a while. So here's a devlog thing thats going on right now.

Games I like:
- Hotline Miami
- Ultrakill
- DOOM
- DUSK
- Titanfall 2
- PAYDAY 2
- Ghostrunner
- Deep Rock Galactic
- Skyrim
